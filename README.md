# ðŸŽ® First Person Controller 
## By Woyboy

## Unity Version 6000.0.45f1 + Cinemachine 3 Upgrade

### Overview
This simple FPC is a mini first-person controller that is neatly organized and easily customizable. There is nothing complex about this controller other than having the basics of first-person movement, camera controls, and a simple interaction system. The biggest thing about this package is that this controller works directly with the Cinemachine package. This package also includes a flexible, interactable system that allows the player to pick up an object and drop it. This is a very simple yet strong system I made to quickly prototype your projects

## ðŸš€ Features
- First-person movement with sprint and jump
- Cinemachine-based camera control
- Modular interaction system (pickup/drop)
- Namespace-driven architecture
- Editor tools for organization and debugging
